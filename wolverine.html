Especially during colder months, walking long distances can be brutal and many students prefer to drive to save time. Additionally, not all off-campus residences come with parking spots, so some students need to find a place to reliably keep their car for the year. Many students do not have the money to purchase a university parking pass or pay for parking garages and street parking regularly.</td>
          <td>Wolverine parking is a savior for students at the University of Michigan who do not want to waste their precious time searching for a parking spot in the city of Ann Arbor. Not all off campus residential complexes offer a complimentary parking spot and not all spaces near the campus are free to park during all time of the day. In addition it also offer students to sell a parking spot in order to make some money.</td>

    <h3>Sketching & Probable Solution Ideas</h3>
    <p>Getting deeper into the problem after conducting the interviews I came up with different types of solutions possible to cater to the ruckus of parking in Ann Arbor. I made sure to go extremely out of the box and come up with 8 unique solutions.</p>

    <h3>Paper Prototype</h3>
    <p>I used the concept of low fidelity prototyping. The main objective was to display the functions and uses of the product rather than the look and feel. My prototype consisted of a series of paper screens which showed the design attributes. All the probable clickable features for the user were portrayed on each screen. I conducted usability tests using my paper prototype. Upon testing I came across some loopholes and the major traversing problems. I figured out that the prototype was not polished and noted down all the user reactions and pain points while navigating through the paper prototype.</p>

    <br><h3>Try Out the final prototype</h3>
    <br><p>After conducting my research and coming up with low fidelity and medium fidelity prototypes, I created a high fidelity prototype and conducted several user tests as well. </p>
